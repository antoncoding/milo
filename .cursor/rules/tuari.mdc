## Important
* Please use tauri v2 documents, APIs, plugins. If you don't know how a specific feature is achievable in Tauri v2, ask the user for more documentation.
* Do not try to run command. You can assume user is running the dev server on it own. Also this is a pnpm repo, suggest commands like `pnpm run tauri dev` instead of npm
* Do not run commands to check types
